## 📖 About the Project

**Brickstroy** is a fun and interactive **Brick Breaker** game built using **Pygame**.  
The goal is simple — **break all the bricks** using your bouncing ball while controlling the paddle at the bottom.  
If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game is over!

This project is a great example of **game development fundamentals** in Python — including collision detection, object-oriented programming, and real-time rendering.
